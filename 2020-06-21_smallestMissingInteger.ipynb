    "## Proposed solution overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations: \n",
    "- Return value is at most n+1 (the array length + 1).\n",
    "- We don't care about negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea: \n",
    "We need to encode in the array (by modifying it in place) which positive integers in \\[1,n\\] are not observed. \n",
    "An encoding that fulfils this in time complexity O(n) would be to mark the value at array position i with a negative sign when the value i+1 in \\[1,n\\] is observed.\n",
    "Then, the index of the first positive value observed by scanning the modified array left to right is the smallest unobserved strictly positive integer.\n",
    "This only works if the values that are marked are guaranteed positive to start with (or we'd be missing cases), so we also need to group together all strictly positive values at the start of the array and work exclusively on that part of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "- Sort array so that all strictly positive integers span indices \\[0,m-1\\] and all negative integers span indices \\[m,n-1\\] (m<=n). #O(n)\n",
    "- Change the sign of the value at index i (in \\[0,m-1\\]) to negative if the positive integer i+1 (in \\[1,m\\]) exists in array.\n",
    "- Return the index+1 of the first positive value in the array (if index m is reached, return m+1)."
